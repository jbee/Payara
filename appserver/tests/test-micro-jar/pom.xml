    <name>Integration Tests based on payara-micro.jar file</name>
    <description>NOTE: this module is dependent on the payara-micro-distribution being run previously 
    but it cannot have a dependency on this module as this would mess up the classpath for test execution 
    as some classes get in from the modules that have to be taken only from the generated jar file.

    The idea is to test the actual artifact created.
    This is not suitable for all kinds of tests as the accessible API is the minumal payara micro API.
